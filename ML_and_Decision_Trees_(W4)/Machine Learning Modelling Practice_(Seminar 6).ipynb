it predicts the highest number of false positives. From a business/lender perspective, this model increases risk and may cause financial losses by approving risky loans.

They significantly outperform Logistic Regression(which is the lowest performance among the four models) and show a slight edge over the default Random Forest model. Therefore the model rankings is:\n","\n","1. xGBDT/GBDT\n","2. Random Forest\n","3. Logistic Regression\n","\n","The high F1-scores for both classes in GBDT and XGBDT suggest that these models are robust and generalize well to the test data without significant issues like class imbalance impacting their predictive power for either class.\n","\n","Looking at the recall and precision for the two classes, a high recall for class 1 means that fewer good borrowers are wrongly rejected. high precision for class 1 means approved borrowers are likely to repay (lower risk). xGBT has the best balance across both classes:\n","\n","*   Class 1 recall = 0.91 (highest)\n","*   Class 1 precision = 0.89\n","\n","This means xGBDT model has the highest ability to identify creditworthy applicants (GBDT being a close second). This is what lenders would look for in credit scoring and deciding who to lend to.\n","\n","By contrast, logistic regression is the lowest performing model\n","\n","\n","*   Class 1 recall = 0.87 (some good applicants getting wrongly rejected)\n","*   Class 1 precision = 0.85 (some approved loans are risky)\n","\n","\n","Looking at this from an organisational perspective, there's profit loss due to unnecessary rejections and more risk from misapproved loans.\n","\n","\n","\n","The Random Forest model also performs well, but GBDT and XGBDT appear to be marginally superior for this dataset with default hyperparameters.\n","\n","\n","**Next steps:**\n","The next step will be to fine-tune the Random Forest model further to see if its performance can match or exceed that of GBDT and XGBDT. Additionally, I could also perform deeper validation on an unseen dataset to ensure the results I observed are reliable and generalize to new data."],"metadata":{"id":"ywmc57VFpV5e"}}]}
